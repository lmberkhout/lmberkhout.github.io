<b> <u>Teaching</u> </b>

I am an advisor at ASU of the <a href="astrochart.github.io">Completely Hackable Amateur Radio Telescope (CHART)</a> project, which is an outreach project targeted at high school students and teachers and led by undergraduate students. The project is currently a collaboration between Winona State University and Arizona State University, but we are always looking for interested folks.
