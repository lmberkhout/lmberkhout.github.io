# Teaching

I am an advisor at ASU of the [Completely Hackable Amateur Radio Telescope (CHART)](astrochart.github.io) project, which is an outreach project targeted at high school students and teachers and led by undergraduate students. The project is currently a collaboration between Winona State University and Arizona State University, but we are always looking for interested folks.
