<b> <u>Teaching</u> </b>

I am an advisor at ASU of the <a href="astrochart.github.io">Completely Hackable Amateur Radio Telescope (CHART)</a> project, which is an outreach project targeted at high school students and teachers and led by undergraduate students. The project is currently a collaboration between Winona State University and Arizona State University, but we are always looking for interested folks. See a paper we wrote on the project <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6552/ad0542">here</a>, as well as a talk I gave at GNURadioCon 2023 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzkIl8sTvRY">here</a>.
